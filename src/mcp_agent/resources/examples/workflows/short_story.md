The Kitty Castle Adventure!!!

One day, there was three kittens named Whiskers, Fluff and Bob (who wasnt very fluffy at all)! They were wandering around in the forest looking for mice to chase when suddenly.... they saw something HUGE!!!

"MEOWWW!" said Whiskers, "look at that big thingy with the pointy tops!!!"

"I think thats a castle silly!" said Fluff, who thought she was the smartest kitten ever because she watched alot of tv with her human.

Bob didnt say nothing because he was already running towards the big door! The other kittens chased after him, there paws making little pat-pat sounds on the ground.

When they got inside, everything was DUSTY!!! Fluff sneezed so hard she fell over backwards, and Whiskers laughed so much he got the hiccups!

They found lots of cool stuff in the castle like old chairs that were good for scratching (even tho they shouldnt), and curtains that were fun to climb! In the kitchen, they found some mice having a tea party, but the mice were so scared they dropped there tiny teacups and ran away!!!

The kittens spent all day playing in the castle until it got dark. "We better go home" said Bob finally speaking up.

"Yeah but we should come back tomorrow!!!" said Whiskers still with hiccups.

So they went home covered in dust but very happy with there adventure!

THE END!!!!
