# The Kittens and the Mysterious Castle

One sunny morning, four litle kittens named Whiskers, Fluffy, Mittens, and Paws decided too go on a adventure. They were bored of chasin the same butterflies in they're garden everyday.

"Lets explor the forest!" meowed Whiskers, the orange tabby who was always gettin into truble.

The kittens wandered thrugh the trees, pouncing on leafs and chasing eachother until suddenly, Fluffy who was the smallest kitten gasped! "Look guys!!! I see something BIG over there!!"

Infront of them stood a enormus castle with tall towers that seemed to touch the clouds. The walls were coverd in ivy and the windows sparkled like diamonds in the sunlight.

"What is this palce?" asked Mittens, her gray fur standing up from excitment.

"Its a castle dummy!" said Paws, who thout he new everything.

The kittens sneaked thru a broken window and found themselves in a huge room with fancy furniture. They jumped on soft pillows an chased each other up the curtins. Mittens found a crown and put it on her head.

"Im the queen now bow to me!" she demanded.

But then they heared a loud CRASH! They all froze in fear. Was the castle haunted???

It was just Whiskers who had nocked over a vase. Classic Whiskers!

The kittens spent all day explorin rooms, playing hide and seek in closets, and pretending to be royal cats. As the sun began to set, they realized they should go home for dinner.

"Let's come back tomorow," Fluffy sugested, and they all agreed.

Little did they know, the castle wasn't as empty as they thout...
