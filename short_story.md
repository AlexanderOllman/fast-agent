The Kitten's Magical Castle Adventure!!!

Their was three tiny kittens named Whiskerz, Pawsome, and Fluffy-face who was walking in the forest one day when they saw something AMAZING!! A huge castle made of gray stones that touched the sky!!!

"meow omg look at that!!" said Whiskerz who was the most bravest kitten. "lets go inside maybe theirs mice in their!"

Pawsome was kinda scared but followed anyways cause she didnt want to be left behind. Fluffy-face just wanted to take a nap but got dragged along to.

The kittens found a hole in the castle wall and squeezed inside, there paws making tiny pat-pat sounds on the dusty floor. Everything was dark and spooky!!!

"I dont like this" whined Pawsome. But then they found the kitchen!!!!!

The kitchen had lots of old plates and cups, and best of all - MICE! The mice were having a fancy tea party and wearing tiny hats made of paper!!!

"Can we join your party?" asked Fluffy-face who suddenly wasnt sleepy anymore.

The mice were nice and said yes! They gave the kittens tiny paper hats to and served them crumbs of cheese on fancy plates.

From that day on, the kittens visited the castle every week for tea parties with there new mice friends. Even if they sometimes knocked over the cups with there tails by accident!!!

THE END!!!
